# SpacePlayground
Our UE4 playground for testing features for our upcoming game

## Requirements
- Unreal Engine v4.14.3
- Visual Studio 2015 (on Windows)

## How to open it in the editor
Clone the repo and open the project with the **Unreal Editor**.

![Select project](/docs/ProjectSelector.png)

![Browse for project](/docs/ProjectBrowse.PNG)

If this is the first time you load the project, a screen like this will appear:

Just click **Yes** and it will compile the project and get everything ready:

## How to edit the code
If you want to open the code inside Visual Studio or XCode, follow [this instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/ManagingGameCode/index.html) to generate the projects for each platform.

Once this is done, you'll be able to modify the Levels inside the editor and the code inside Visual Studio or XCode.
