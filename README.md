If you want to open the code inside Visual Studio or XCode, follow [this instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/ManagingGameCode/index.html) to generate the projects for each platform.

Once this is done, you'll be able to modify the Levels inside the editor and the code inside Visual Studio or XCode.
